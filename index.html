        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            All star cheerleading is one of the fastest growing competetive sports in the world.
            You can find the sport itself at cheer gyms.
            What makes all star cheer different is the style of the sport. No cheers all skills.
            Making your favorite team is hard work. Most of our favorite athletes have moved across the country to be on their dream team.
            Allstar cheer ranges from levels 1-7. The level you compete on is dependent upon tumbling skills and stunting abilities.
            Level 1 starts off with basic skills such as cartwheels and ground stunts where as in level 7 you can do basket stunts that allow you
            to flip in the air. The scope is so broad that there is a level for everyone.
